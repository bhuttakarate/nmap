# nmap
Nmap - the Network Mapper. Github mirror of official SVN repository.
Forking this library out to see what one can do with this. List Looking around. Will be forking the master on a branch called first 
time then tinker around.

Anyone curious about looking inside is wasting their time. Dont plan to get anywhere with this anyway .... -- just yet, at least.

Cheers.
